# Signaux

This is an add-on for Snudda (https://github.com/Hjorthmedh/Snudda) that allows more flexible specification of inputs.  

### Usage

Signaux should be used once a network has been created and synapses detected/pruned, but before calling SnuddaInput. 
Signaux can either create new spike trains, or sample existing ones.
